# Subscription Onboarding Funnel

## Context:
Otrium is introducing a subscription model that offers exclusive benefits to members. The
objective is to increase the number of users signing up for subscriptions. However, the current
onboarding funnel is slow and has a high drop-off rate. Your job is to redesign the subscription
onboarding process for speed, simplicity, and increased conversions.

## Task:
You are tasked with designing and building an optimized onboarding funnel.

## Deliverables:
  1. System Architecture:
      - Design the architecture for an onboarding funnel that integrates with the existing Otrium platform.
      - Propose an optimized API structure to handle account creation, payment processing, and subscription management.
  2. Problem-Solving:
      - List the potential technical challenges (e.g., handling payment failures, ensuring mobile optimization).
      - Suggest scalable solutions for these challenges.
  3. Hands-On Coding Challenge:
      - Implement a REST API in Node.js that allows:
      - User registration.
      - Subscription plan selection.
      - Payment processing (use mock data).
  4. Team Collaboration:
      - Describe how you would align with the Product team to ensure that the onboarding flow is user-friendly.
      - Explain how you would delegate tasks to your engineers and ensure timely delivery
